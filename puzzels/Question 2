First level each bottle of wine with both its decimal number 1 to 1000 and the binary equivalent.
Where a 1 Means the prisoner who are not poisoned and 0 means the prisoner who are poisoned.
Label the 10 prisoners A to j. Then each bottle serves as an indicator for which prisoners are to drink from a bottle of wine. 
For example Now letâ€™s suppose that everyone except prisoner j is poisoned.

	        A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J

	    	0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1


If we translate 0000000001 into decimal we get 1.
 Which means bottle 1 was poisoned. 
This confirms what we know to be true because Prisoner j was the only prisoner not to drink from bottle



convert the number of prisoned prisoners back into decimal notation to reveal which bottle has been poisoned.



		      A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J

	    1 	0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1

	    2 	0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0

	    3 	0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1

	    4 	0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0

	    5 	0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  1

	    6 	0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  0

	    7 	0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1
	    
	    8 	0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0
	    
	    9 	0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  1

	    10  	0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  1  0	



How about if prisoners A, C, E, G and I are poisoned?

	
				A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J
				
				0  1  0  1  0  1  0  1  0  1



translate the number 0101010101 into decimal to determine which bottle it was.
 010101010 = 170
Hence, bottle number 170 was the poisonous bottle.
